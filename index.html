      <h3 class="general">General Care</h3>
      <p>It all may seem daunting, but if you incorporate these tips into your fish care routine you’ll end up with 
        a pretty tank full of healthy fish. Once your tank is up and running the care and maintenance required to keep it 
        going really should not take up a lot of your time. As little as an hour a week is all that’s needed, maybe less 
        depending on tank size.</p>
      <p>Remember that fish are not disposable pets, and if you choose to keep them in your home they are worth taking 
        the time to care for properly. Like any animal, your tropical fish need a clean, safe, and stress-free living 
        environment. It’s up to you to make that possible, and it’s not as hard as it seems.</p>
      <p>
        Start with tropical fish if your aquarium is heated. Most aquarium fish sold in stores are tropical fish. 
        There are many types to choose from, including neon tetras, guppies, and bettas. 
        These fish need a consistent aquarium heater in order to survive. Many warm water fish serve as a beautiful but 
        low-maintenance addition to an aquarium.</p>
      <p>Maintaining the water temperature is very important for this type of fish. Check the heater often and consider 
        getting an aquarium thermometer.</p>
      <p>Raise saltwater fish for hardier pets that require more maintenance. Saltwater fish are a little trickier to 
        maintain than freshwater fish. Saltwater fish tend to be more expensive and require you to keep a close watch on 
        the aquarium’s salinity level. If you are willing to watch the salinity, saltwater fish are almost as easy to 
        care for as any tropical breed.</p>
      <p>Some examples of saltwater fish include firefish, yellow shrimp goby, Klein’s butterfly fish, and coral beauty 
        angelfish. Metal components in saltwater will rust over time. Get a tank and equipment designed for use with 
        saltwater to reduce rusting.</p>
      <p>Fill the tank with lukewarm tap water and dechlorinate it. Since you don’t have any fish in the tank yet, add 
        the tap water directly to it. Fill it all the way up, then add some water conditioner into the water. Follow the 
        manufacturer’s instructions to add the appropriate amount for the size of tank you own. When the water is ready, 
        scoop some up and pour it into the tank’s filter to get it ready.
      <p>The water needs to be lukewarm so it doesn’t damage the tank. Don’t let cracked glass ruin your fish’s new home!</p>
      <p>Clean it once a week--happy fish, happy...life.</p>
      <p>Fish have feelings too. Give them at least three positive affirmations each morning!</p>
      <p>Kiss the fish good morning and good night, every day!</p>
